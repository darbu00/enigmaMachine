1. Finish encryption/decryption option
  1. Encrypt char is done but can be improved.
  2. Encrypt message method added but not finished -- I think this is now complete, but improvable.
  3. Need to add method/option to encrypt from keyboard input
  4. Should convert digits (0-9) to words (zero - nine) for encryption -- complete
  5. Should convert spaces to a predefined character set; i.e. <space> = QZ -- partially complete
      Space saves as u200B (empty space) if hiddenSpaces = true
      Needs improvement
  6. Move allowSpecialCharacters and hiddenSpaces to Encryptor
...
n. Add gui
