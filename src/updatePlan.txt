1. Finish encryption/decryption option
  1. Encrypt char is done but can be improved.
  2. Encrypt message method added but not finished -- I think this is now complete, but imporavable.
  3. Need to add method/option to encrypt from keyboard input
  4. Should convert digits (0-9) to words (zero - nine) for encryption -- complete
  5. Should convert spaces to a predefined character set; i.e. <space> = QZ -- complete, space saves as u200B (empty space)

...
n. Add gui


1 create -- complete
2 configure -- complete (?)
3 load -- reader method done, loading of saves not yet done.
4 save -- writer method done, saving data not yet really complete though test saves are working
5 encrypt/decrypt -- nearly complete
